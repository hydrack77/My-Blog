There she strides; crafted by the delicate hands of the universe—an aesthetic mess conjuring bohemians to her shore. Paralleled by youth and desire, she persists to hang on every thread of webs woven along her perplexed existence. She often seems resilient to crumble, diving headfirst to the jaws of uncertainty. 

“People spoon on from the eaves, Hydrack,” she said in her own wordings while leaning on my shoulders this other night—you can see her exquisite figure lay still while she fights her urge to sleep. It’s so enticing. Then, she curls up and gazes into the abyss wondering about the whatnots and you can notice life itself beaming off of her glance. Her silent wonderment enchants a sense of comfort and you resonate with her presence. She’s in the fleet without knowing the mad voyage ahead. She turns back and smiles and you can’t help but feel joyous for being accompanied by such being. And she makes the revolting thought of existence feel endurable.
