# A Heretic of Some Sort

> Why heretic? 

Because I don’t believe in any of the rhetoric things I’ve said nor claimed to have seen (impressions of a mad man). I sense a lack of originality in my disputes with the universe. My idle mind spawns over shoots of erratic seeds sown that have become incapable of sprouting due to lack of care. ዶሮ ብታልም ጥሬዋን አሉ. 

The recurring thoughts of certain emotions intrigue an array of pixels in my head. **Bespoke; I’m a captive of my own (distorted) memories**. But as soon as the mind is aware of its deeds, escapism latches itself to save the day. As ironic as it sounds, everything’s a bridge to its constituents. And, my mind floods itself with pool of contents for consumption in an attempt to stay sane, deceiving me with feelings I’d rather be feeling. Is this not a mere display of deception? ሥራ ማጣቱስ አይደል መነኩሴውን ቆብ ቀዶ ሚያሰፋው? 

# Thus, the curse of idleness—errands of deceit. Heretic is what I’ve become, an oblivious fanatic desperate to clench on the clues of the universe, for I am left with obscurity to trust my wits and the memories I possess.
