> Reverberations

Trickling sounds running, trailing 
---

goosebumps erected by repercussions
---

a cruel salvation
---

hymns became the ailment and the remedy 


ears conjuring sounds, they know
---

ears conjuring sounds, they feel
---

tingling the souls of empty vessels

Feelings conjured by a bunch of molecules’ vibrations. Splitting the tiniest matter’s composure, we’d get energy constantly disfiguring to rearrange itself into particles. And, this sack of energy creates a whole being which in turn has a sense to feel the energy around it. And thus, sound became enticing. A circuit of reverberating energy for more than the receptors, for the heart and soul. To mend the confusions other coordinated molecules have caused.
